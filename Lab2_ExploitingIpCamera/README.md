# Lab 2: Exploiting an IP Camera (Writeup)
### Tools Needed
### Introduction
  In this laboratory, the students explored Embedded Device Hacking. It started with the first exploitation technique, which is to gain root access via a serial communication interface technique. This was done with the most common serial on the embedded device, which is Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART). The device to be exploited is opened, the chipsets on the PCB are identified, the datasheets are located, the exposed UART ports are identified, and root access to the device is obtained through connections to the UART ports of the device. This lab is useful even for beginners who have not worked with hardware in the past as it guides the student through the entire process of identifying vulnerabilities and exploiting the hardware component of IoT devices.
